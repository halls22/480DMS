TODO

    things that are asked for in the report:
        - a benchmarking program
            - i mean.. seriously.. I think maybe this should just be an included 
            feature. so like.. you can run
                store 
                retrive
                visualization
                ...
                we should have "benchmark" that returns times
        - how to set the software up
            > I planned on putting the final version in my public folder
            so we can give them a script that just runs
                "java ~hallwort/public/setup_dataservice"
    
    Drew:
        work on metadata
        method to pass array of filesizes
    
    Daniel
        look into making the data servers and metadata servers multithreaded
        finish making the pixel visualization
        
        
    soo much shit to do here... honestly.
