To run DRS:
1. interpret the code:
javac *.java

2. make sure you have a config file. see config.txt for formatting example

3. ssh into the data servers listed in the config file, and 1 additional machine for the 
MetaData Server

4. To run MetaData Server:
Usage: java MetaDataServer <port> <degree of replication>

5. To run Data Server:
Usage: java DataServer <port>

6. To run Client:
Usage: java Client <metadata-host> <metadata-port>

	Client commands once client has started:
	Store:
		DRS store Usage: store <full path to file> <file name to be used in drs>
	Retrieve:
		DRS retrieve Usage: retrieve <file name in drs> <file name to be used in local file system>
	Status:
		DRS status Usage: status
	Exit:
		DRS exit Usage: exit


so for example: 
java Client lincoln 9000
>store test.txt a.txt
>retrieve a.txt test2.txt
>status
>exit

this will store the file test.txt as a.txt, retrieve and store it as test2.txt, show the status of the DRS, and exit.
